# Encryption
Encryption Team Project
This is a team project about creating an encryption alphabet using a word prompted from the user and combine it with the reversed alphabet, removing all duplicates. This program will read an input text file message and will translate it or encrypt it to an output text file and that will be the encrypted message. The learning experience here was working with my teammates in making a decision and research. We were in a situation that we, as a team, had to make a decision about which version are we going to turn in for grading. At the end, we did exceptionally and it was a great experience because we did get stuck at some point but my team help me with making the program run smoothly for submission. I had originally authored this project to meet the demands of the assignment, which is to use command line arguments and work with the command line prompt, running it from there. I did a little bit of research to learn how to to do this and it was amazing experience. I will attach in another repository, the version with command line arguments. This file will be CastroGerardoAssignment4.
